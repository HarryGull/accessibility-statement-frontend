accessibilityProblems:
  - users are not warned before being signed out when their session ends.
  - on smaller screens or when zoomed there is a menu link in the header which when selected reveals the sign-out link. The appearance of the sign-out link is not announced to screen-reader users and as the sign-out link appears on the other side of the page this can also be an issue for screen-magnification users.
  - information to assist in the filling of forms is present on pages but is not announced to screen-reader users who may be navigating by form field.
  - on several pages more fields are revealed when selecting a particular answer and the way these are placed may result in screen-reader users not being able to work out what is being asked from the input alone.
  - the ‘back’ link still has to be navigated by keyboard users even when using the skip to main content link.
  - on the page ‘Are you sure you want to withdraw your application?’, the email address confirmation has a label which has the email address but not the question. The question is presented after the label. This can cause issues for screen-reader users.
  - error messages are present on pages but are not announced to screen-reader users who may be navigating by form field.
  - on the page ‘Application submitted’ there is a table which has been incorrectly coded so may cause issues for screen-reader users.
  - there are some links which have been made to look like buttons but have not been made to act as buttons for keyboard users and which are not exposed as buttons to screen-reader users. Using the spacebar to action these will cause the page to scroll instead.
  - some pages have a section of content which is revealed when actioning a link, but the content includes a link which can be focussed by a keyboard user even when the section is hidden.
  - some pages which ask for personal information have not been set up so that you can fill them in easily using information stored in your browser.
  - there are several places, such as the cookie banner, where colour contrast is not as good as it should be and so may cause difficulties with reading.
