serviceName: Claim back import duty and VAT
serviceDescription: |
  Claimants can use the service to claim back import duties, VAT and other customs charges. The service can be used if the claimant paid too much duty or VAT on goods they imported into the UK, if the goods were returned or rejected as they were damaged or not as ordered, or to claim a refund on an import security deposit or guarantee they paid to HMRC.

accessibilityProblems:
  - Some users may find it difficult to understand the purpose of pages with the file upload control as there are some inputs that do not have a label associated with it. They may find it difficult resolving any errors or removing uploaded files.
  - When navigating the 'Claims summary' section using the search or pagination, screen reader users may not realise a new page has loaded as the page title stays the same.
  - On the 'Check your answers before sending your claim' page, the change links for the uploaded files do not correctly let users know where they will be taken.
  - On the 'Enter the Movement Reference Number (MRN)' page, users need to enter the data again when there is an error.
  - Fieldsets and legends are grouped and labelled to related content. On the ‘Who will the repayment be made to?’ radio buttons have descriptive text within a details component acting as a legend meaning screen readers are aware the radio buttons are related to the text.
  - Abbreviations are used and expanded in the first instance. For example, MRN is spelled as Movement Reference Number, and MRN is used after that.
milestones:
  - description: The link ‘claim template’ opens in a new tab without a warning. This will cause confusion to users, especially those with cognitive and low vision issues and screen readers users. When trying to go back to the original page, screen reader users will realise that using Alt+Left arrow will not take them back to the original page making navigation harder, as they have not been provided with the information that the link has been opened in a new tab.
