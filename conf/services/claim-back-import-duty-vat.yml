serviceDescription: |
  Claimants can use the service to claim back import duties, VAT and other customs charges.

accessibilityProblems:
  - On some 'check your answers' pages, when using the ‘change’ links, previously entered information will not have been saved and users will have to enter the information again.
  - There is a missing dialogue box that warns users that they need to extend the time allowed to complete tasks before their session ends.
  - When errors occur, the error prefix has not been translated into Welsh, which could prevent Welsh-speaking users from correctly identifying it as an error.
  - The sections for 'tell us about your goods and security deposits' have multiple radio buttons that are not grouped which can make it difficult to know what they relate to.
