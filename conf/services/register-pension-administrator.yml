accessibilityProblems:
  - on the ‘do you have working knowledge’ page, the radio buttons have not been set up correctly which could make it difficult for screen-reader users to understand the connection between them and the heading.
  - for the email input field, numeric keyboards are displayed for screen-reader users on mobile devices. This prevents users from entering the required information.
  - the low contrast between the light-blue text and white background will make it difficult for users with low-vision to see the link on the tiles.
